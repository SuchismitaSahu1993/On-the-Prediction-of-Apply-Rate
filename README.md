# Project "On the prediction of Apply Rate":

## Introduction

The problem of interest is the prediction of apply rate. Imagine a user visiting Glassdoor, and
performing a job search. From the set of displayed results, user clicks on certain ones that she is
interested in, and after checking job descriptions, she further clicks on apply button therein to land in
to an application page. The apply rate is defined as the fraction of applies (after visiting job description
pages), and the goal is to predict this metric using the dataset described.
